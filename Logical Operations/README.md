# Basic Image Operations using OpenCV

This module explores fundamental concepts of **image processing** using the **OpenCV** library in Python.
It focuses on hands-on experiments covering image manipulation, arithmetic, and bitwise operations.


## **Technologies Used**

* **Python 3**
* **OpenCV (cv2)**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**


## **Concepts Covered in this Experiment**

### 1. Basic Image Operations

* Loading, displaying, and saving images using `cv2.imread()`, `cv2.imshow()`, and `cv2.imwrite()`.

### 2. Array Operations with Images

* Performing element-wise operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using NumPy arrays.

### 3. Image Resizing and Cropping

* Changing image dimensions using `cv2.resize()` and extracting regions of interest (ROI) with array slicing.

### 4. Bitwise Operations

* Applying `cv2.bitwise_and()`, `cv2.bitwise_or()`, `cv2.bitwise_xor()`, and `cv2.bitwise_not()` for feature masking and extraction.

### 5. Image Arithmetic

* Combining or blending multiple images using weighted addition and subtraction.
